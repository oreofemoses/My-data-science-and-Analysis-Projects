# My-data-science-and-Analysis-Projects
This repository houses a compilation of data science and analysis projects that I have diligently undertaken, accompanied by their corresponding associated files.
The ANN.ipymb file  consists of various sections related to implementing machine learning models using Python, particularly using libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras. Here's a brief summary:

1. **Perceptrons:**
   - Uses scikit-learn to implement a perceptron for iris dataset classification.
   - Demonstrates basic usage of the Perceptron model.

2. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Backpropagation:**
   - Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to create an MLP for fashion MNIST dataset classification.
   - Preprocesses the data, builds a neural network with hidden layers, and compiles the model.
   - Trains the model, evaluates its performance, and visualizes the training history.

3. **Building a Regression MLP:**
   - Implements a regression MLP using Keras for the California housing dataset.
   - Splits the dataset, scales the features, builds, compiles, and trains the model.

4. **Building Complex Models Using the Functional API:**
   - Explores building models with multiple inputs and outputs using Keras Functional API.
   - Implements wide and deep models with shared and separate layers.

5. **Saving and Restoring a Model:**
   - Shows how to save and load Keras models using `save` and `load_model`.
   - Introduces the `ModelCheckpoint` callback for saving models during training.

6. **WideAndDeepModel Class:**
   - Defines a custom Keras model class for wide and deep models.
   - Encapsulates the architecture within the class, making it easier to use.

Overall, the code covers a range of topics, including perceptrons, MLPs, regression, complex model architectures, and model saving/loading using popular machine learning libraries.
